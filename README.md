# DSW_in_025_models

DSW formation and export is not well represented in current climate models. DSW export down the continental slope leads to AABW formation as DSW mixes with ambient water. In climate models, AABW is formed in the open ocean instead of on and near the continental shelf. Simulating realistic AABW comes down to two challenges which are both related to the model grid. First, the models need form DSW on the continental shelf, [recent work has shown]([url](https://github.com/willaguiar/DSW-collaborative-project)) this is enhanced with a high vertical resolution, in particular of the surface grid cell. Second, once DSW is formed, the model needs to export it down the slope. This depends on the horizontal grid. The problem hereby is that coarse-resolution models mix too much resulting in too light AABW. Parameterisations that enhance downslope transport of dense waters exist, but are regarded as not very efficient. Motivated by the new insights into the role of the vertical model grid for the formation of DSW, this work tests if AABW formation in coarse (horizontal) resolution models can be improved by (i) increasing the vertical resolution and (ii) making use of existing overflow parameterisations. + Extension of this work by looking at the new generation OM3 and CM3 models.
